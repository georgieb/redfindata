The leadership at the school was really embarrassing and it is sad that it remains the same as when I graduated. There was little respect for students from administration and the faculty, but I wouldn't blame it all on them...there were many disrespectful students who would make anyone lose faith in a structured and civil learning environment. One of the saddest things I can remember is that teachers had friendships with students outside of the school's walls.

I am a friend of students, a friend of faculty, and have subbed a few times. I passed through the public school system in Dade County.There are a few general things to consider about schools:1. The student's level of academic involvement affects what teachers they receive. Example: taking an AP course makes it more likely that the student interacts with a higher quality teacher.2. Most teachers in all schools are jaded, but an enthused student that really wants to learn can motivate a capable teacher to at least give what they can offer to that kid.Now let me talk about the experience I have had with the school:This school has one of the best advanced math programs in the country. There a numerous teachers of a caliber you can not understand. Some of them show up a full hour early, teaching optional classes or offering their time to assist any student that asks. They stay at school some times for 3 hours after the bell rings to perform these same services. They leave school only to continue talking about their students with each other and their plans for the kids to guarantee their success. The school ranked 10th last year in the national Mu Alpha Theta math competition, competing against plenty of private schools and math magnets. This year there were two seventh graders that made scores in the 700s on the math SAT (a test for highschool seniors that has a max score of 800). These teachers rarely miss a day, and when they do they make sure they get a sub that knows the material and will teach.Not all math teachers are a part of this mission, and not all math students WILL benefit from it, but any student that wants to improve or excel in math will have a variety of quality resources to accomplish that. If you believe that math is one of the most important parts of educating a student to become an adult that learns quickly and makes decisions based on logical thought and probability, there is no better place in the county for that to occur than at Doral Academy.", 'reviewerRating': 5, 'lastUpdatedDate': 'October 2023', 'institutionGreatschoolId': 1204804, 'maponicsId': 1681036, 'url': 'https://www.greatschools.org/florida/doral/4804-Doral-Academy-Charter-High-School/'}, {'schoolId': 39693599, 'reviewedBy': 'Other', 'datePosted': 'May 2015', 'review': 'I cannot begin to describe how I feel about this school. I was very optimistic when I enrolled my children here but after the first month I withdrew my son (7th grade) and my daughter (6th grade) has finished the school year there but not without some serious headaches. Let me give 2 examples of the things that I encountered with my daughter being there this year. There was a Science test assigned for Monday. On the portal where the children retrieve their Homework, it showed the Science test to be on Tuesday. When she got to class on Monday the teacher gave the test (even though she would be giving the test for 2 more days). When kids in the class said that online it said the test was Tuesday, the teacher responded, well I said on Friday it would be today and proceeded to give them the test & change the online info in the middle of the class period to read test on Monday. When I wrote the Asst. Principal about this, she said let me look into it. ( I am still waiting to hear back) The other example is in History class the children were assigned on a Tuesday, to GOOGLE the answers to 10 influential people of a certain time period, 15 definitions and 15 essay answer questions for a test on Thursday. 2 days! and to GOOGLE information?! Has anyone ever tried to Google the answers to anything? You get 100 different answers and who knows which one is correct!! When I wrote the teacher regarding this, I never received an answer back and the test wasn\'t given due to "the copier being broken" and the kids were never given the test. I can go on and on with hours and hours of homework. My daughter spending all weekend doing busy work that made no sense, on top of Reading Plus and Carnegie, a math system that is absolutely ridiculous that even her father, a financial analyst, found tedious and pointless.
